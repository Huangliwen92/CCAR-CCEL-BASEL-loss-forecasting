his README description focuses exclusively on CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review). It is tailored for a professional risk management portfolio, emphasizing stress-testing under the Federal Reserve's regulatory framework.CCAR-9Q: Supervisory Stress Testing & Capital ProjectionMotivationThis repository provides a quantitative framework for Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), specifically focusing on the 9-quarter (2.25 years) planning horizon. The goal is to evaluate whether a financial institution has sufficient capital to continue operations and lending during periods of extreme economic stress.Unlike standard baseline forecasting, this framework utilizes Supervisory Stress Scenarios (Base, Adverse, and Severely Adverse). It models the "Peak-to-Trough" impact on capital ratios by projecting quarterly Net Charge-Offs (NCOs) and Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) conditioned on macroeconomic shocks like spikes in unemployment, equity market crashes, and GDP contraction.The 9-Quarter Planning HorizonThe models in this repository are designed to project the financial health of a portfolio from the "Jump-off" date through the following nine quarters.Quarters 1–4: Capture the immediate impact of the economic shock.Quarters 5–8: Capture the peak delinquency and default rates.Quarter 9: Evaluates the bank's ability to maintain capital buffers as the scenario stabilizes.Repository Structuresrc/modelssatellite_models.py: Logistic and OLS regression models that link portfolio performance (PD/LGD) to macroeconomic variables ($Unemployment$, $HPI$, $GDP$).ppnr_engine.py: Forecasts Pre-Provision Net Revenue, including interest income and non-interest expenses under stress.rwa_calculator.py: Computes Risk-Weighted Assets over the 9-quarter horizon.src/projectionsloss_projection.py: The core engine that rolls the portfolio forward quarter-by-quarter.capital_aggregator.py: Aggregates losses and revenue to calculate the CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) ratio at each point in time.scenarios/Contains the yearly Fed-provided macroeconomic data:fed_2025_severely_adverse.csvfed_2025_baseline.csv
